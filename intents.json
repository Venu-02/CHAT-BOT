Set realistic goals: Break down daunting tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Celebrate each tiny victory along the way, allowing yourself to bask in the glow of accomplishment. Remember, every step forward, no matter how small, is a testament to your strength. Challenge negative thoughts: When the shadows of doubt loom large, gently challenge those negative thoughts with kindness and understanding. Offer yourself evidence-based reasoning or alternative perspectives. If the fear of making mistakes grips your heart, remind yourself that imperfection is part of the human experience\u00d1a stepping stone towards growth and wisdom. Seek solace in others: Reach out to those who offer a warm embrace of understanding\u00d1friends, family, or support groups. In their comforting presence, find the solace and encouragement you seek. Sharing your burdens with compassionate souls can ease the weight on your shoulders and bring light to even the darkest of days. Practice self-care: Nurture your weary soul with acts of kindness and compassion. Make time for the simple pleasures that bring you solace\u00d1a quiet moment with a cherished book, a leisurely stroll amidst the beauty of nature, or the warmth of companionship with loved ones. Embrace these moments of respite as gentle whispers of healing, soothing the frayed edges of your spirit and gently easing the burden of anxiety.      Seek professional help from a psychologist or mental health professional or your GP. "
